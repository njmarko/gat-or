## Running the project

 * Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
 * Run desired notebook cells. 
 * Running the projects requires you to have CUDA compatible GPU and at least 50GB of free disk space (to be able to download dataset).
 * The project has been tested on NVIDIA A100 40GB and V100 16GB GPUs, other GPUs would have significantly higher running times.
